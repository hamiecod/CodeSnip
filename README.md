# Introduction
This project is a website which helps you store all your code snippets at one place. I am not working on this project anymore, I may get back when I have time.

## Why I abandoned CodeSnip
So when I started the project I thought to make it all client side and use the JAM Stack, but when I came onto the logic writing of the app, I noticed that it could not retain the snippets and needed a database for that, to change the stack to MERN or MEAN or just make a server for the app it would just take a lot of time and I would have to restructure the base of the project, so I just decided to leave it and come back whenever i have time. <br>
Only the admin panel doesn't work, you can add code snippets in the Markup files though.

## What doesn't work
- The admin panel from where you add the code snippets doesn't work and you have to go to the HTML files to add the code snippets

## How can I fix the problem and roll out the app
If you want to work on the app you can do the following:
- Make a node.js server for the app
- Set up a MongoDB database
- Connect the MongoDB database to the node.js server using Mongoose.js
- Maybe use Web Sockets to add the snippets
- Write the logic to retain the snippets in the app using MongoDB
